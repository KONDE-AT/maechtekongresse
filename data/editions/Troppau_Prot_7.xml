               common rights and duties of the Contracting Parties, all extraneous Questions have
               been treated of in such a manner as to leave the several Allied<pb n="174v"/> Powers
               at Liberty to accomodate their Decisions upon them to their own peculiar position,

            <p>The British Government, in replying to the Communications thus brought under their

            <p>Most of the Topics therein touched upon have been examined by<pb n="175r"/> them in

               those Principles as guiding their Decision upon the present occasion, which have

            <p>Had this Document not been conveyed to the knowledge of the Allied Courts, the well
               known Principles of the British Government must nevertheless have assured<pb n="176r"/> them that a Revolution, bearing on the face of it such evident traces of an occult
               Sectarian Conspiracy and of Military Revolt against a mild and paternal Government,
               could not have been viewed otherwise than with equal pain and distrust by a State,
               which regards such dangerous expedients as little adapted to establish reciprocal
               Confidence between a Sovereign and His People, or to contribute to the Establishment
               of any rational or well<pb n="176v"/> regulated System of Freedom; but whilst the
               pernicious character of this change was then fully admitted, the British Government
               felt it a duty at the same time to declare that whatever danger might be expected to
               flow from the example of such an Event, it was not regarded by them as so directly
               bearing upon the particular Safety of <country>Great Britain</country> as would
               induce or, according to their received notions, could justify them in making

               by the Allied Cabinets.</p>
            <p>The decision thus taken is a sufficient proof that the British Government did not
               regard the Question of <country>Naples</country> as one falling within any of the
               Provisions of existing Treaties, upon which it would be contended that the <hi rendition="#u">Casus Foederis et Belli</hi>,<pb n="179r"/> therein specified, had
               arisen, or even that the special Obligation to deliberate in common with the Allies,
               as specified in the 3<hi rendition="#su">d</hi> Article of the <rs ref="#t.6">Treaty
                  of Alliance</rs>, could in this particular case be alleged to exist.</p>
            <p>They took their Determination therefore under the pressure of the exigency, and in
               the exercise of what appeared to them their undoubted right, and by that
               Determination the line of their duty must be most scrupulously regulated.</p>
            <pb n="179v"/>
            <p>In laying down this Principle of non-interference for the rule of their own conduct,
               the British Government has never presumed to prejudge the Decision of the other
               Allied Powers, or to question the grounds upon which they either collectively or
               individually may deem it incumbent on them to adopt a different course of Policy.</p>
            <p>His Majesty’s Government have from the first admitted that the Position of some of
               the Continental Powers, and<pb n="180r"/> specifically the Position of
                  <country>Austria</country> and of the Italian States, was essentially different
               from that of <country>Great Britain</country>, and they have professed their
               disposition to respect whatever Decision They, as Independent Powers, might take upon
               full Deliberation for the security of Their own Dominions; provided always that due
               assurance was given that the <rs ref="#t.12 #t.1">Territorial System of Europe as
                  settled by late Treaties</rs> was not thereby intended to be disturbed.</p>
            <pb n="180v"/>
            <p>As far as the present Discussions have gone, it is but Justice to the several Allied
               Powers that the British Government should declare that they have unequivocally
               evinced a Disposition altogether exempt even from the suspicion of any interested or
               ambitious purpose, and without being understood to give any opinion upon the
               propriety of the Political Conclusions, to which They appear to have come with regard
               to the Affairs<pb n="181r"/> of <country>Naples</country>, as bearing upon Their own
               Security (an Opinion, which the British Government, in their Neutral Character, do
               not feel themselves called upon either to form or to pronounce). They nevertheless,
               under the particular circumstances of the Case, certainly cannot feel either the
               Disposition or the Right to oppose themselves to their Determination.</p>
            <p>Having stated thus much upon the General Principle of the proposed Interference, the
                  <rs ref="#p.137">Undersigned</rs> is directed<pb n="181v"/> to declare, on the
               part of His Government, as an obvious and necessary Corollary from the Principles
               above laid down, that they must likewise decline being Parties to any executory
               measures which may grow out of such Interference and that, if the Entry of an
               Austrian Army into the <country>Kingdom of Naples</country> should give occasion to
               any temporary System of Military Occupation, resembling<pb n="182r"/> that to which
               the <rs ref="#t.1">Treaty of Peace in 1815</rs> gave rise in
                  <country>France</country>, <country>Great Britain</country> can take no share in
               its execution, nor can the British Government otherwise interfere, than in
               exercising, in concert with the Alliance, that general “Surveillance” with respect to
               the nature and duration of that Occupation, which devolves upon them not as matter of
               Option, but as a Duty under existing Treaties and as Guardians of the General
                  Territorial<pb n="182v"/> Balance and Settlement of Europe.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="#p.137">Undersigned</rs> is further directed to decline, but in the most
               friendly manner, the Overture contained in the <ref target="Troppau_Prot_1.xml">
                        <rs ref="#p.8">Austrian Minister’s</rs> Note of the <date when="1820-10-29">29<hi rendition="#su">th</hi> of October</date>
                    </ref>, in which it is proposed
               that the Allied Powers should take an engagement not to recognize, but with common
               consent, the existing order of Things at <country>Naples</country>, so long as the
               Conferences at <placeName ref="#loc.60">Troppau</placeName> shall last, which
                  Proposition,<pb n="183r"/> having been accepted by <rs ref="#p.13 #p.14 #p.121 #p.11 #p.12 #p.136">the Russian and Prussian
                  Plenipotentiaries</rs>, has since, at the instance of the Russian Cabinet, been
               made absolute and without restriction as to time.</p>
            <p>It is not that the British Government has it in contemplation at present to advise
                  <rs ref="#p.130">His Majesty</rs> to grant Credentials or to receive them from the
               existing Government of <country>Naples</country>, but as the Principles above
               explained preclude them from being Parties to the more extended Concert, in<pb n="183v"/> which the other Powers are engaged, they feel it in point of
               Consistency incumbent on them not to participate in this particular Branch of that
               Concert.</p>
            <p>Having submitted the reasons, which have determined His Court under existing

                  the Year 1815</rs>, as agreed to by <rs ref="#p.130">His Majesty</rs> and
               sanctioned by Parliament.</p>
            <p>To the reasoning contained in this short Analysis of their Foreign Relations, the
               British Government desires to be understood as adhering, and They feel it Their duty
               to declare, that Reflection has only served to confirm Them in the conviction that
                  every<pb n="187r"/> attempt to reduce such a System to practice must not only
               fail, but that the avowal of such a description of League among the Great Allied
               Powers would seriously tend in various ways to aggravate the danger to which it
               professes to apply a Remedy.</p>
            <p>This being Their matured and deliberate conviction, They owe it to Themselves and to
               the Allied Cabinets, so far as the opinion of the British Government can have weight,
               to dissuade them from attempting to reduce<pb n="187v"/> to an abstract rule of
               conduct possible Cases of Interference in the internal Affairs of Independent
               States.</p>
            <p>Such Interference every Power has an undoubted right to employ upon the Principle of
               Self defence in a case of adequate Necessity, but to be just, it must rest upon some
               evident practical danger, to be specially inferred from all the circumstances of the
               particular case, but which never can, <hi rendition="#u">a priori</hi>,<pb n="188r"/>
               be made the subject matter of an Alliance between the Great Powers of Europe.</p>
            <p>The Transactions of 1815, with regard to <country>France</country>, were expressly
               founded upon the overbearing and conquering character, which that particular
               Revolution had assumed to the terror of all Europe, but it does not follow that the
               same course of Policy can be made universally applicable to all other
               Revolutions.</p>

               state that the <rs ref="#p.130">King</rs>, His Master, is fully alive to the great

            <p>
                    <rs ref="#p.130">His Majesty</rs> has received these assurances from Them as a fresh
               and valuable Pledge, not less of Regard than of Confidence, and They may rest assured
               that His Majesty’s attachment to Their August Persons<pb n="189r"/> and to the
               Interests of the Alliance is unabated and imperishable, and that <rs ref="#p.130">His
                  Majesty</rs> will always be found ready to fulfil with Zeal and Promptitude those

               to their Allies to confine Their views to special cases of public danger, as they may
               from time to time arise, rather than to pledge Themselves beforehand to interfere on
               every occasion when Political Changes may be brought about in any State by what may

                  their reasons for such Decision</metamark>. But as this Protocol appears<pb n="134v"/> rather to be intended to form the Basis of a General System which,
               after being proposed to the consideration of the other Allied Courts, is, if agreed
               to by Them, <metamark rend="Bleistiftstrich" place="margin">to assume the character
                  of a Treaty or to be promulgated to Europe as a System of international Law, to
                  which the accession of other Courts is to be invited</metamark>, the Question in
               that view assumes a character such as must necessarily<pb n="135r"/> awaken the
               attention of all European States with regard to its principles as well as its
               provisions.</p>
            <p>In looking at the effects of this Protocol, and examining its bearings in the latter
               point of view, the first question that arises is, in what position does it place the
               Contracting Parties, first towards each other, and secondly towards independent
                  States,<pb n="135v"/> not being Parties to its obligations?</p>
            <p>Before we examine this, it may be well to state generally the nature of its
               provisions.</p>
            <p>It professes to assign to the contracting Parties under the name of the <hi rendition="#u" hand="#AmB">Alliance</hi> the right and the duty of declaring any
               particular State, in which a change of Government has been effectuated by what they
                  <add place="inline">may</add> deem irregular or illegal means, to be <hi rendition="#u">ipso<pb n="136r"/> facto</hi> excluded from the European Alliance:
               An immediate separation from the State, thus placed as it were in Outlawry, is to be
               the first consequence of such Declaration; and in the event of amicable intervention
               failing to procure the reestablishment in that State of such an order of things as
               may, in the judgment of the contracting Parties, entitle it to be received again into
               the Bosom<pb n="136v"/> of the Alliance, Coercive Measures are to be had recourse to
               for the purpose of enforcing the same.</p>
            <p>It is impossible for those who value the Alliance the most highly, and who from
               experience are the most highly and unfeignedly impressed with its characteristic
               Benevolence and Liberality, not to feel alarmed at the very idea of challenging in a
               formal Instrument a claim on its behalf to the exercise of such<pb n="137r"/>
               unexampled power as this; a Claim which is represented in the Protocol to rest upon
                  <quote>“une application légitime et salutaire des principes, sur lesquels se fonde
                  Leur Alliance”</quote>. – It may be asked from what Principle of existing Treaties
               the Alliance finds Itself entitled to draw such a conclusion. Certainly not from the
                  <rs ref="#t.6">Treaty of Alliance of November 1815, signed at <placeName ref="#loc.2">Paris</placeName>
                    </rs>.</p>
            <p>At the close of an unexampled war carried<pb n="137v"/> on against Them by the
               Revolutionary Government of <country>France</country> the Allies, under the
               extraordinary Circumstances of being obliged a second time to march Their Armies into
               that Kingdom, felt Themselves entitled to take the precautions contained in that <rs ref="#t.6">Treaty</rs>; and They justified its extraordinary provisions
               exclusively upon the necessity of the particular case. But surely it is impossible to
               bring forward what was applied to <country>France</country> at the close<pb n="138r"/> of such a War and under Circumstances so peculiar as a precedent which is to
               justify the Alliance in placing all Europe, including so many States that were
               associated as Allies in that <hi rendition="#u" hand="#AmB">struggle, in the same
                  state of <hi rendition="#u">surveillance</hi> as was then on special grounds
                  applied to <country>France</country>
                    </hi>.</p>
            <p>
                    <country>France</country> might be said to make the Peace with Her eyes open, in
               contemplation of the <rs ref="#t.6">Treaty of Alliance</rs>.</p>
            <p>But where is the like title to be found for the assumption of the five Powers<pb n="138v"/> of a similar, or rather of a much more penal Superintendance over all
               the other States of Europe?</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="#t.6">Treaty of Alliance</rs>, after stipulating the exclusion of the
                  <rs ref="#p.50">Usurper</rs>’s Family forever from the Throne of France, binds the
               Allies in the event of any Revolutionary Convulsion in <country>France</country> only
               to <hi rendition="#u">deliberate</hi> together for the common safety, with a view to
               the adoption of such measures as the Safety of Europe under such an exigency might
                  require.<pb n="139r"/> But the <hi rendition="#u">Protocole Préliminaire</hi> in
               Article 5 proceeds at once to recognize their authority to place Armies of Occupation
               in the Territories of such of those States as the Alliance may deem to require such a
               precaution.</p>
            <p>If a title to assume such powers cannot be contended for as founded upon any general
               Principle or upon any existing Treaty, is it intended to invite all other States to
               accede to this League and thus, by their voluntary<pb n="139v"/> consent, to submit
               themselves in such cases to the Jurisdiction of the Alliance?</p>
            <p>Can it be supposed that all the other States of Europe will choose to accede <hi rendition="#AmB">to such a System? And if not – what is to be the position of the
                  non-acceding States</hi>?</p>
            <p>What would be the effect of such accession upon the Political situation of the
               greater number of Sovereigns that might be called upon to give it, and upon Their
               Subjects?</p>
            <p>Would it not bear the appearance of separating<pb n="140r"/> Themselves from Their
               own people and of looking to Foreign Aid for the safety of Their Thrones?</p>
            <p>Could the <rs ref="#p.15">King of France</rs> for instance accede to such a Treaty
               without exposing Himself to the very inconvenience which the Allies dissuaded His
               Majesty wisely in 1815 from incurring?</p>
            <p>Could the <rs ref="#p.30">King of Spain</rs>, without the utmost and most immediate
               peril to His personal safety, as well as to His Throne?</p>
            <pb n="140v"/>
            <p>It is also material to consider what would be the situation of the Five Great
               European Powers with respect to each other, were the Principle promulgated in this
               Protocol to be recognized.</p>
            <p>It is to be presumed that whatever rights are therein claimed, the exercise of such
               rights is to be reciprocal between the Parties.</p>
            <p>Are then the Great Powers of Europe prepared to admit or to recognize such a
               Principle, as that Their respective Territories are thrown open to this<pb n="141r"/>
               extent to each other’s approach upon cases of assumed necessity or expediency, of
               which not the Party receiving aid, but <metamark rend="+ mit Bleistift" place="margin">the Party administering</metamark> it is to be the Judge?</p>
            <p>I should much doubt whether such a Doctrine would be palatable in any one of the
               great Monarchies in question; but with regard to <country>Great Britain</country>, no
               Minister could venture to advise the <rs ref="#p.130">King</rs> to sanction such a
               Principle.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="#t.44">Act of Settlement</rs>, by which the Succession to the Throne is
                  regulated,<pb n="141v"/> has expressly provided that it is contrary to Law for the
               King, under any Circumstances, to introduce Foreign Troops into the Realm, without
               the Consent of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Under this Law, were <rs ref="#p.130">His Majesty</rs> to be advised to recognize
               this Principle that in any possible event, even at His own specific invitation, much
               more at the discretion of other Powers, Foreign Troops might, without the Consent of
               Parliament, come into the Country with a view of interfering in its internal
               Affaires, not only<pb n="142r"/> would such a recognition be wholly illegal and
               invalid, but so revolting would it be to every Class and Description of the People
               that it might shake His Majesty’s Title to His Throne, if not expiated by the
               punishment of the Minister, by whom such advice had been given.</p>
            <p>From such a Principle the British Government must not only dissent, but protest
               against any attempt to consider it as under <hi rendition="#u">any imaginable
                  Circumstances</hi> capable of being applied to the<pb n="142v"/> British
               Dominions.</p>
            <p>It may however be alleged that nothing more is meant than to reassert the Right which
               belongs to every Independent State to interpose in the Affairs of a neighbouring
               State, by whose Internal Convulsions its own Peace and Security are menaced or
               endangered, and to declare on the part of the Contracting Parties Their fixed
               Determination, under the present Circumstances of Europe, pregnant as they
                  undoubtedly<pb n="143r"/> are with peril to the Stability of all Governments, to
               act together, as set forth in the Protocol, in all such cases for the common safety.
               But here is a wide distinction. It is proposed to create a Confederacy for the
               Exercise of a Right, which though undoubtedly appertaining, upon Principles of
               Selfdefence in extreme Cases, to each particular State, has never yet as a general
               Measure been made the subject either of a Diplomatic Regulation<pb n="143v"/> or
               conjoint exercise.</p>
            <p>It is proposed to assume on the part of the Alliance a Sovereign Power over the other
               States of Europe equivalent to that, to which the German States have mutually
               submitted themselves in case of internal Convulsion, but which in the German League
               is to be administered not at the discretion or by the force of the most powerful
               Members of the Confederacy, but by the force of the League itself and under the<pb n="144r"/> discretion of its Diet.</p>
            <p>In this Case no such Conventional arrangement has been or can well be made.</p>
            <p>
                    <metamark rend="+ mit Bleistift" place="margin">The claim to exercise such a
                  Power</metamark> may not only excite among the Nations of Europe great uneasiness,
               but may provoke sooner or later Counter-Alliances.</p>
            <p>There are extreme Rights to which Nations, as well as Individuals, must have recourse
               for Their own preservation, and for the exercise of which no Legislation can provide
               Rights, which must be left to originate<pb n="144v"/> in and to be limited by the
               necessity of the especial Case.</p>
            <p>The extreme Right of Interference between Nation and Nation can never properly be
               made a matter of written stipulation or be assumed as the Attribute of any
               Alliance.</p>
            <p>It must in each Case be an exception to the General Rule.</p>
            <p>It cannot be incorporated with the acknowledged practice of Nations, or provided for
               beforehand by the ordinary Forms of Diplomatic Transactions. Such an innovation<pb n="145r"/> seems the less called for in the present moment, as after preliminary
               explanation with Their Allies the Three Powers have taken Their <metamark rend="+ mit Bleistift" place="margin">determination upon the particular point of
                     <country>Naples</country>
                    </metamark> as freely as They could have done under
               the existence of such a Protocol.</p>
            <p>If the other Powers have pursued a different course of Policy, They have neither
               pretended to oppose Themselves to the Decision of Their Allies, nor have They evinced
               any Disposition to obstruct Them in what<pb n="145v"/> They regard to be a measure of
               public safety.</p>
            <p>Why then contract any new Engagement, or promulgate any new Code on so grave and
               delicate a subject?</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be conceived that the Publication of some formal Act by the Great
               Powers may, at the present moment, serve to discourage the Enterprises of the
               Factions in all Countries and animate the well-disposed with more Confidence to
               resist their evil Machinations.</p>
            <p>But would not the<pb n="146r"/>
               <metamark rend="+ mit Bleistift" place="margin">course of Measures, in which the <rs ref="#p.16 #p.18 #p.17">Three Allied Sovereigns</rs>
                    </metamark> are engaged in
               the case of <country>Naples</country>, speak more forcibly for itself, than any
               written instrument proceeding from the same Parties could do?</p>
            <p>If however a Declaration of the Sovereigns is, in <metamark rend="+ mit Bleistift" place="margin">addition, deemed necessary</metamark> to enforce their Sentiments
               or to awaken the deluded to reflection, might not such a Declaration <metamark rend="+ mit Bleistift" place="margin">find its place in Ministerial Notes,
                  explanatory of the</metamark> Considerations which have determined their
                  Interference<pb n="146v"/> in this particular case, and without hazarding a new
               diplomatic proceeding altogether without example?</p>
            <p>If the Powers confine Themselves to the Question of <country>Naples</country> and lay
               down Their general Principles without reference to any other Case, those Principles
               will speak for themselves, but They by this Course pledge Themselves to no other
               proceeding than that in which They have already embarked: They thus avoid creating
               unnecessary alarm and exciting expectations as well as<pb n="147r"/> apprehensions,
               which might fruitlessly disturb the peace of other Countries.</p>
            <p>It is also to be considered that, if the promulgation of such a novel Confederacy may
               express in some degree the prevailing spirit of Military Revolts, it may on the other
               hand arouse in those States, which have latterly through such means received a
               Representative Form of Government, that spirit of Military Energy which was the
               distinctive and most formidable Character of the French Revolution, but of which<pb n="147v"/> the late Revolutions have as yet exhibited no Symptom.</p>
            <p>The apprehension of an armed Interference in their internal Affairs may excite them
               to arm; may induce them to look with greater jealousy and distrust than ever to the
               Conduct of their Rulers, in short, may accelerate the progress of Republican
               Principles and perhaps lead to the Destruction even of the semblance of Monarchical
               Institutions within those States.</p>
            <p>What hope in such a case of a better order<pb n="148r"/> of things to result from the
               prudence and calm deliberations of a People, agitated by the apprehension of Foreign
               Force, and how hopeless on the other hand the attempt to settle by Foreign Arms or by
               Foreign Influence alone any stable and rational System of Government.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to do more in this Dispatch than to point attention to some of the
               most important bearings of this extensive and formidable subject.</p>
            <p>Enough has however<pb n="148v"/> been stated to prove that the present may be
               regarded as an important Era in the European System; and whether the reasoning
               brought forward be convincing or not, it is at least sufficient to shew what an
               unbounded field for Agitation and Controversy the promulgation of such an Instrument
               as the <hi rendition="#u">Protocole Préliminaire</hi> must immediately open.</p>
            <p>
                    <metamark rend="+ mit Bleistift" place="margin">
                        <rs ref="#p.137">Your Lordship</rs>,

               which it would swell this Communication too much<pb n="149r"/> to enumerate, will
               decline, in the name of Your Court, being an acceding Party to the Protocols in
               question.</p>
            <p>You will distinctly understand that this determination on the part of His Majesty’s
               Government does not rest upon the <metamark rend="+ mit Bleistift" place="margin">

                    </metamark> of the particular

                  being removed by any partial modification of their stipulations</hi>.</p>
            <p>They feel Themselves obliged to dissent from the fundamental Principle<pb n="149v"/>
               upon which these Protocols rest, namely that of rendering the Powers either of the
               existing or of any other Alliance avowedly and <hi rendition="#u">systematically
                  applicable</hi>
               <hi rendition="#u" hand="#AmB">under any Circumstances</hi> to the internal
               Transactions of independent States.</p>
            <p>The British Government will always claim on their own behalf and will recognize in
               others the Right of such an Interference upon an adequate necessity.</p>
            <p>They also are ready fully to acknowledge that in the present situation of Europe,
                  and<pb n="150r"/> considering the happy union which, <hi rendition="#u">for
                  limited and defined purposes</hi>, subsists under Treaty between its principal
               Powers, it would be highly advantageous that any particular Power or Powers, before
               they proceed to act upon such an extreme Right, should open their intentions as well
               as their motives to the Alliance, in order that the Allied Powers may thereby receive
               the requisite assurance that, in prosecuting such measures of National Security, the
               Powers so acting entertain no views inconsistent with the general Territorial<pb n="150v"/> Settlement and Balance of Europe.</p>
            <p>The British Government can never regard the question of Interference in each
               particular instance as one which the Alliance is to be called in to decide; but as
               one which appertains exclusively (under the check above described) to the particular
               State or States menaced or immediately endangered.</p>
            <p>The other System appears to Them at once to lead to the creation of a species of
               General Government<pb n="151r"/> in Europe with a superintending Directory,
               destructive of all correct notions of internal Sovereign authority.</p>
            <p>Such a System would not only render the connexion of the five Powers offensive to
               other independent States, but must rapidly tend by familiarizing their minds with
               ideas of Foreign Influence and Interference to destroy all wholesome National Energy
               and all independent action, more especially within the smaller States.</p>
            <p>The British Government<pb n="151v"/> have not observed without Reprobation and Alarm
               the machinations of secret Societies and the success of the Military Insurrections of
               the present day.</p>
            <p>They regard them as more likely to consign the Countries, in which they may occur,
               through scenes of Bloodshed and Confusion to the hateful Repose of a Military
               Despotism than to conduct them to any improved System of regular Liberty.</p>
            <p>But the Disapprobation<pb n="152r"/> and the dread of those perilous evils must not
               be permitted to hurry them into the opposite, and as they would regard it, not less
               fatal extreme of becoming (as the Protocol appears to contemplate) <metamark rend="Bleistiftstrich" place="margin">armed Guardians of all Thrones,</metamark>
               without even regard to the Principles upon which the Powers of Government are
               administered.</p>
            <p>They feel that such a Guarantee could not be morally given without involving a Claim
               to pronounce upon, and to interfere with the mode<pb n="152v"/> in which the supreme
               authority in each particular State so to be guaranteed is exercised: a Claim
               absolutely incompatible with the Independance or Dignity of the local Sovereign.</p>
            <p>Under these impressions the British Government must continue to regard the right of
               Interference in the concerns of other Nations as one to be exclusively used by a
               State or States with a view to their own immediate Security or to the Preservation of
               those national Interests, for the maintenance of which a recurrence to War<pb n="153r"/> would be justifiable, but it cannot consent to charge itself as a
               Member of the Alliance with the Moral Responsibility of administering a General
               European Police of this description.</p>
            <p>It is true, it has not been contended in support of the proposed Projet that the
               Letter of any of the existing Treaties warrants such an Interpretation of the Powers
               or Duties of the Alliance, and it is only under the Sanction of the alleged Spirit of
               the <rs ref="#t.6">Treaty of 1815</rs> that it is sought to assign those<pb n="153v"/> powers and those duties to the Alliance by the Protocols now under
               consideration.</p>
            <p>The British Government, in declining to accede to such a System, gives full credit to
               the Governments, by whom it is proposed, for the purity and benevolence of Their
               Intentions; but conscientiously believes that the result of adopting such a Principle
               (though comparatively safe in the hands of the <rs ref="#p.16 #p.18 #p.17">August
                  Sovereigns</rs>, who now happily fill the Thrones of those powerful States)
                  would<pb n="154r"/> in the long run be productive of more misrule and even of more
               Revolutions in Europe than the leaving of extreme cases of public danger from time to
               time to find as heretofore their corrective in the Interference not of an Alliance,
               but of the Power or Powers most directly interested in their Repression.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency will make a communication to the Allied Courts of this frank avowal
               of the <rs ref="#p.130">King</rs>’s Sentiments upon the result of Their late
               Deliberations.</p>
            <p>However painful it must be to <rs ref="#p.130">His Majesty</rs> on<pb n="154v"/> any
               occasion to differ in opinion from those <rs ref="#p.16 #p.18 #p.17">August
                  Sovereigns</rs> to whom He is so firmly and so cordially attached; yet upon a
               Question of this peculiar nature, whatever may be their ultimate decision, <rs ref="#p.130">His Majesty</rs>’s own course must necessarily be regulated by those
               prudential maxims, which are known to have at all times governed the Policy of
                  <country>Great Britain</country>.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="#p.130">King</rs> trusts that He will not be regarded however as
               presuming to interfere bejond the just limits of those<pb n="155r"/> obligations
               which unite His Majesty with His Allies; if He should again recommend to Their
               considerations the wisdom of not being tempted by the nature of their own particular
               Institutions to hazard an experiment which cannot fail to excite public feelings and
               public discussions throughout Europe, the effects of which in the present state of
               moral and political ferment no human foresight can estimate, and no Combination of
               its Powers may be able to controul.</p>
